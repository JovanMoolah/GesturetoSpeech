# GesturetoSpeech
This application automatically convert gestures in ASL fingerspelling to text and then voice. It includes all numbers and letters. Gestures for 'j' and 'z' only include one position.

Gestures for '0' and 'o', and 'v' and '2' are the same. If the previous gesture is a number, the gesture is '0' and '2'. If the previous gesture is a letter, the gesture is 'o' and 'v'. Default states for those gestures are 'o' and '2'.

Additional gestures: 'delete', 'enter' and 'space' are used to delete text, start speech and separte words. 
All gestures are seen in diagram below
